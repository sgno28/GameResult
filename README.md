# GameResult

This code simplifies process of formatting the game result data in the case where passport nfts show as null

# Constraints
 only works so far for csv's already put in rank order
 Only formatts for wolfgame and mfers 

# Returns
 Gives you a formatted database which default save name is formatted, you can change this (recommended)
 Prints out the ascii table for you so that you can just copy and paste and use in the webhook website:

# Steps:
 1. First download the game data as a csv and place in same folder where you will run this code. Id recommend changing the name of the file to something easy like
 "date_and_game_number.csv"
 2. Open the main() file (this is the file you need to run)
 3. Change the name of the file to be uploaded (in the code) to match the csv file of the game data you just uploaded. 


# Notes
 This file has previous game data already if you want to test it first.
 If you already have a formatted csv and just want to get the ascii table then you can just use the ascii table code
