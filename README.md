# Steps:
## 1. First download the game data as a csv and place in same folder where you will run this code. Id recommend changing the name of the file to something easy like
## "date_and_game_number.csv"
## 2. Change the name of the file to be uploaded (in the code) to match the csv file of the game data you just uploaded.
